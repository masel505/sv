Changes:
==============================================================
The HTTPGrab class was not being used in the library and has been 
depreciated to eliminate excessive overhead during library builds. 
Only one standalone function was being in the 
examples.soc/gxshttpc/testprog.cpp file. That function has been moved 
to the examples.soc/gxshttpc/testprog.cpp file. NOTE: The httpgrab.h 
include file and the httpgrab.cpp src files are only included with 
this distribution for backward compatibly with existing makefiles that 
may have dependencies requiring these files to exist during a library 
build.
